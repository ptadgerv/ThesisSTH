  abstract = {Pooled testing of units is a common approach in the prevalence estimation of infectious agents, which leads to a reduction of total costs of diagnostic testing. We examine how the pool size affects the statistical properties of the prevalence estimator r{\fontencoding{LECO}\selectfont\char177}. Exact formulae are used to determine bias and precision of r{\fontencoding{LECO}\selectfont\char177}. It is shown that with moderate pool sizes the (upward) bias of r{\fontencoding{LECO}\selectfont\char177} is negligible. If there is no diagnostic error, the random error of increases slightly with higher pool sizes, whereas if sensitivity and specificity are lower than 1, pooling may markedly decrease the random error of r{\fontencoding{LECO}\selectfont\char177}. Another reason why pooling may be beneficial (and even indispensable) is that it greatly reduces the huge bias that can result if the assumed values of the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test are not equal to the true values. The numerical calculations show that, in case of prevalence rates of up to 5\% and total sample sizes of n{$\geq$}500, pool sizes of about 10 to 20 are generally satisfactory from a statistical viewpoint. The methodological advantages and disadvantages of more complicated pooling strategies involving repeated testing of units are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, among the most common neglected tropical diseases, continue to be a major threat to the health and socioeconomic wellbeing of infected people especially children in developing countries. Methods: A cross-sectional study among 254 aboriginal schoolchildren was conducted in order to determine the current prevalence and intensity of infections and to investigate the potential risk factors associated with moderate-to-heavy burden of STH infections among these children. Results: Overall, 93.7\% of children were found to be infected with one or more STH species. The prevalence of trichuriasis, ascariasis and hookworm infections were 84.6\%, 47.6\% and 3.9\%, respectively. Almost half of the participants had heavy trichuriasis, one-quarter had heavy ascariasis whereas all hookworm infections were light infections. Overall, moderate-to-heavy STH infections accounted for 56.7\% of the total infections. Univariate analysis revealed that those using untreated water supply (P = 0.013), living in houses without toilets (P = 0.027) and having domestic animals in the houses (P = 0.044) had significantly higher prevalence of moderate-to-heavy infections than others. Logistic regression analysis confirmed using untreated water for drinking (P = 0.001) and the absence of a toilet in the house (P = 0.003) as significant risk factors of moderate-to-heavy STH infections among these children. Conclusion: The high proportion of moderate-to-heavy STH infections further confirms the need for serious attention towards these devastating diseases that has put lives and the future of aboriginal children in jeopardy. Introduction of more poverty alleviation schemes, proper sanitation, provision of clean and safe drinking water, health education, as well as the introduction of periodic school-based deworming programmes are imperative among these communities in order to curtail the transmission and morbidity caused by STH.},

This study was conducted to assess the prevalence and intensity of STHs infection among individual members living within the selected household heads (HHs) certified either as a model HHs or non-model HHs based on the implementation level of a training program known as the Health Extension Program (HEP). A community-based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June 2018 at Seka Chekorsa Woreda, Jimma zone. Model and non-model HHs were selected systematically from each of the randomly selected district villages employing a multistage sampling technique. Sociodemographic and risk factors data associated with STHs infections were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. Parasitological stool sample microscopic examination was done using saline wet mount and Kato Katz thick smear technique. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software version 20 for descriptive statistics, comparison, and logistic regression at a p-value {$<$} 0.05 for statistical significance. Overall, 612 individuals were recruited in the study from 120 randomly selected HHs. The prevalence of STHs infections was found to be 32.4\%. A total of 45 (14.7\%) model and 153 (50.0\%) non-model individual participants were positive for at least one species of STHs showing a significant difference between individuals in model and non-model HHs (AOR: 6.543, 95\% CI; 4.36\textendash 9.82, P{$<$}0.001). The dominant STHs were T. trichiura (21.6\%) followed by A. lumbricoides (6.4\%) and hookworms (2.3\%). The intensity of T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides infection have shown a significant difference (p{$<$}0.05) while hookworm species infection was not significantly different (p{$>$}0.05) for the individuals in the HHs groups. On the other hand, the households training status, age of participants, and latrine use pattern were found significant predictors of STHs infection prevalence in the multivariate analysis (P{$<$}0.05). Therefore, the prevalence and intensity of STHs infection was higher among individuals living in a non-model HHs than model HHs.},

Methods Statistical methods for skewed count data are described and compared, with reference to those used over a ten year period of Tropical Medicine and International Health. Two parasitological datasets are used for illustration. Results Ninety papers were identified, 89 with descriptive and 60 with inferential analysis. A lack of clarity is noted in identifying measures of location, in particular the Williams and geometric mean. The different measures are compared, emphasizing the legitimacy of the arithmetic mean for skewed data. In the published papers, the t test and related methods were often used on untransformed data, which is likely to be invalid. Several approaches to inferential analysis are described, emphasizing 1) non-parametric methods, while noting that they are not simply comparisons of medians, and 2) generalized linear modelling, in particular with the negative binomial distribution. Additional methods, such as the bootstrap, with potential for greater use are described. Conclusions Clarity is recommended when describing transformations and measures of location. It is suggested that non-parametric methods and generalized linear models are likely to be sufficient for most analyses.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In this study, two traits related with resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) were measured in 529 adult sheep: faecal egg count (FEC) and activity of immunoglobulin A in plasma (IgA). In dry years, FEC can be very low in semi-extensive systems, such as the one studied here, which makes identifying animals that are resistant or susceptible to infection a difficult task. A zero inflated negative binomial model (ZINB) model was used to calculate the extent of zero inflation for FEC; the model was extended to include information from the IgA responses. RESULTS: In this dataset, 64\% of animals had zero FEC while the ZINB model suggested that 38\% of sheep had not been recently infected with GIN. Therefore 26\% of sheep were predicted to be infected animals with egg counts that were zero or below the detection limit and likely to be relatively resistant to nematode infection. IgA activities of all animals were then used to decide which of the sheep with zero egg counts had been exposed and which sheep had not been recently exposed. Animals with zero FEC and high IgA activity were considered resistant while animals with zero FEC and low IgA activity were considered as not recently infected. For the animals considered as exposed to the infection, the correlations among the studied traits were estimated, and the influence of these traits on the discrimination between unexposed and infected animals was assessed. CONCLUSIONS: The model presented here improved the detection of infected animals with zero FEC. The correlations calculated here will be useful in the development of a reliable index of GIN resistance that could be of assistance for the study of host resistance in studies based on natural infection, especially in adult sheep, and also the design of breeding programs aimed at increasing resistance to parasites.},

However, the sensitivity of the technique is low, particularly for the detection of light-intensity helminth infections.

We present a model which estimates the sensitivity of the Kato-Katz technique in Schistosoma mansoni and hookworm, as a function of infection intensity for repeated stool sampling and provide estimates of the age-dependent `true' prevalence. We find that the sensitivity for S. mansoni diagnosis is dominated by missed light infections, which have a low probability to be diagnosed correctly even through repeated sampling. The overall sensitivity strongly depends on the mean infection intensity. In particular at an intensity of 100 eggs per gram of stool (EPG), we estimate a sensitivity of 50\% and 80\% for one and two samples, respectively. At an infection intensity of 300 EPG, we estimate a sensitivity of 62\% for one sample and 90\% for two samples. The sensitivity for hookworm diagnosis is dominated by day-to-day variation with typical values for one, two, three, and four samples equal to 50\%, 75\%, 85\%, and 95\%, respectively, while it is only weakly dependent on the mean infection intensity in the population.

While the diagnostic specificity of Kato-Katz is very high, the sensitivity varies strongly with infection intensity and the number of samples collected and thick smears per sample tested. Therefore, the performance of Kato-Katz in a population depends on the distribution of infections in the population and individual-level data are needed to determine the `true' prevalence of infection. However, modeling capacity to determine `true' prevalence from individual-level data is often not available to program managers. In this study, we therefore provide simple equations to estimate the `true' prevalence and associated uncertainty from observed prevalence and arithmetic or geometric mean infection intensity for a variety of common sampling schemes. We find that by including information about the mean infection intensity in a population the estimation of `true' prevalence can be improved compared to assuming a constant value for the diagnostic sensitivity and supply parameters and functions to calculate the `true' prevalence of infection.},

Intervention thresholds for Schistosoma mansoni are currently defined for prevalence measured by stool microscopy using the Kato-Katz technique. However, the Kato-Katz technique shows low sensitivity, particularly for the detection of light-intensity infections. Replacing it with the semi-quantitative point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (POC-CCA) urine cassette test requires translation of the thresholds and precise characterization of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we applied a novel egg-count model to a suite of data obtained from different settings in Africa and the Americas with diverse endemicity levels. We used a simulation study to infer on the relation between Kato-Katz and POC-CCA prevalence. Based on our study, we were able to provide recommendations for POC-CCA thresholds taking into account semi-quantitative results of the test. We found that a S. mansoni prevalence of 10\% based on duplicate slide Kato-Katz thick smear is equivalent to 15\textendash 40\% POC-CCA prevalence when trace results are considered positive and to 10\textendash 20\% POC-CCA prevalence when trace results are considered negative.

  abstract = {Studies sometimes estimate the prevalence of a disease from the results of one or more diagnostic tests that are applied to individuals of unknown disease status. This approach invariably means that, in the absence of a gold standard and without external constraints, more parameters must be estimated than the data permit. Two assumptions are regularly made in the literature, namely that the test characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) are constant over populations and the tests are conditionally independent given the true disease status. These assumptions have been criticized recently as being unrealistic. Nevertheless, to estimate the prevalence, some restrictions on the parameter estimates need to be imposed. We consider 2 types of restrictions: deterministic and probabilistic restrictions, the latter arising in a Bayesian framework when expert knowledge is available. Furthermore, we consider 2 possible parameterizations allowing incorporation of these restrictions. The first is an extension of the approach of Gardner et al and Dendukuri and Joseph to more than 2 diagnostic tests and assuming conditional dependence. We argue that this system of equations is difficult to combine with expert opinions. The second approach, based on conditional probabilities, looks more promising, and we develop this approach in a Bayesian context. To evaluate the combination of data with the (deterministic and probabilistic) constraints, we apply the recently developed Deviance Information Criterion and effective number of parameters estimated (pD) together with an appropriate Bayesian P value. We illustrate our approach using data collected in a study on the prevalence of porcine cysticercosis with verification from external data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by mainly Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma hematobium. The disease is very common in Africa including Ethiopia. Schistosoma mansoni is a major public health problem in Ethiopia especially among children. This review is aimed to indicate the prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni among children at the national and regional levels. METHODS AND MATERIAL: The PRISMA guidelines were followed. An electronic search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, and Google search were carried out using key terms. Articles published from the proceeding of professional associations such as the Ethiopian medical laboratory association, the Ethiopian public health association, and annual national research conferences were also searched to find additional eligible studies. Data were extracted independently by two investigators, and cross-checked by a third reviewer. The quality of included studies was assessed using JBI quality assessment criteria. Data were extracted using Microsoft excel and finally analyzed using STATA version 12. The pooled prevalence was done using a random-effects model. RESULT: Overall 49 studies involving 20,493 children (10,572 male and 9, 921 females) were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection was 37.13\% (95\%CI:30.02-44.24). High heterogeneity was observed with I2 of 99.4\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.000. According to subgroup analysis, the pooled prevalence was high in the SNNPR (41.49\%: 95\%CI: 19.52-63.46) followed by the Amhara region (41.11\%: 95\%CI: 30.41-51.8), the Tigray region (31.40\%: 95\%CI:11.72-51.09), and the Oromia region (28.98\%: 95\%CI: 18.85-39.1). Year from 2011 to 2015 contributed to the highest prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection among children (46.31\%: 95\%:34.21-59.05). CONCLUSION: This study revealed a 37.13\% prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection among children. This is an alert to improve and implement appropriate control strategies such as mass drug administration in Ethiopia.},

In such a situation, the estimation of prevalence is difficult if none of the tests is considered to be a gold standard. In this paper we develop a Bayesian approach to estimating disease prevalence based on the results of two diagnostic tests, allowing for the possibility that the tests are conditionally dependent, but not conditioning on any particular dependence structure. This involves the construction of four models with various forms of conditional dependence and uses Bayesian model averaging, enabled by reversible jump MCMC, to obtain an overall estimate of the prevalence. This methodology is demonstrated using a study on the prevalence of Strongyloides infection.},

Therefore, this study aimed to provide a summary and location of the available data on STHs infection among preschool and school-age children in Ethiopia. METHODS: The search was carried out in Medline via PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar on data published between 1997 to February 2020 for studies describing the rate of STHs infection among preschool and school-age in Ethiopian. We followed the Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) approach to identify the studies. Meta-regression was performed to understand the trends and to summarize the prevalence using the "metaprop" command using STATA software version 14.0 RESULTS: A total of 29,311 of the 61,690 children examined during the period under review were infected with one or more species of intestinal parasites yielding an overall prevalence of 48\% (95\% CI: 43-53\%). The overall pooled estimate of STHs was 33\% (95\% CI: 28-38\%). The prevalence was 44\% (95\% CI: 31-58\%) in SNNPR, 34\% (95\% CI: 28-41\%) in Amhara region, 31\% (95\% CI: 19-43\%) in Oromia region and 10\% (95\% CI: 7-12\%) in Tigray region. Soil-transmitted helminths infection rate has been decreasing from 44\% (95\% CI: 30-57\%) pre-Mass Drug Administration (MDA) era (1997-2012) to 30\% (95\% CI: 25-34\%) post-MDA (2013-2020), although statistically not significant (p\,=\,0.45). A lumbricoides was the predominant species with a prevalence of 17\%. CONCLUSION: Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples Region, Amhara, and Oromia regions carry the highest-burden and are categorized to Moderate Risk Zones (MRZ) and therefore, requiring MDA once annually with Albendazole or Mebendazole. The prevalence of STHs decreased after MDA compared to before MDA, but the decline was not statistically significant. A. lumbricoides was the predominant species of STHs among preschool and school-age children in Ethiopia. The high prevalence of STHs observed in this review, underscores the need for better control and prevention strategies in Ethiopia.},

  abstract = {Background It is common in public health and epidemiology that the outcome of interest is counts of events occurrence. Analysing these data using classical linear models is mostly inappropriate, even after transformation of outcome variables due to overdispersion. Zero-adjusted mixture count models such as zero-inflated and hurdle count models are applied to count data when over-dispersion and excess zeros exist. Main objective of the current paper is to apply such models to analyse risk factors associated with human helminths (S. haematobium) particularly in a case where there's a high proportion of zero counts. Methods The data were collected during a community-based randomised control trial assessing the impact of mass drug administration (MDA) with praziquantel in Malawi, and a school-based cross sectional epidemiology survey in Zambia. Count data models including traditional (Poisson and negative binomial) models, zero modified models (zero inflated Poisson and zero inflated negative binomial) and hurdle models (Poisson logit hurdle and negative binomial logit hurdle) were fitted and compared. Results Using Akaike information criteria (AIC), the negative binomial logit hurdle (NBLH) and zero inflated negative binomial (ZINB) showed best performance in both datasets. With regards to zero count capturing, these models performed better than other models. Conclusion This paper showed that zero modified NBLH and ZINB models are more appropriate methods for the analysis of data with excess zeros. The choice between the hurdle and zero-inflated models should be based on the aim and endpoints of the study.},

  abstract = {Detection/nondetection data are widely collected by ecologists interested in estimating species distributions, abundances, and phenology, and are often imperfect. Recent model development has focused on accounting for both false-positive and false-negative errors given evidence that misclassification is common across many sampling protocols. To date, however, model-based solutions to false-positive error have largely addressed occupancy estimation. We describe a generalized model structure that allows investigators to account for false-positive error in detection/nondetection data across a broad range of ecological parameters and model classes, and demonstrate that previously developed model-based solutions are special cases of the generalized model. Simulation results demonstrate that estimators for abundance and migratory arrival time ignoring false-positive error exhibit severe (20\textendash 70\%) relative bias even when only 5\textendash 10\% of detections are false positives. Bias increased when false-positive detections were more likely to occur at sites or within occasions in which true positive detections were unlikely to occur. Models accounting for false-positive error following the site-confirmation or observation-confirmation designs generally reduced bias substantially, even when few detections were confirmed as true or false positives or when the process model for false-positive error was misspecified. Results from an empirical example focusing on gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) abundance in Wisconsin, USA reinforce concerns that biases induced by false-positive error can also distort spatial predictions often used to guide decision making. Model sensitivity to false-positive error extends well beyond occupancy estimation, but encouragingly, model-based solutions developed for occupancy estimators are generalizable and effective across a range of models widely used in ecological research.},

  abstract = {Control of soil-transmitted helminthiasis and schistosomiasis relies heavily on regular preventive chemotherapy. Monitoring drug efficacy is crucial to provide early warning of treatment failures. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a survey design in which only egg-positive individuals are retested after treatment. Although this practice makes more efficient use of resources, it may lead to biased drug efficacy estimates.We performed a simulation study to assess the potential for bias when evaluating drug efficacy using the World Health Organization\textendash recommended survey design, and to identify alternative designs for evaluating drug efficacy that are less affected by bias. These designs were also based on selection of egg-positive individuals, but involve retesting them a second time at baseline and up to 2 times at follow-up. The utility of the different designs was compared fairly by constraining them to the same budget.The standard procedure of selecting egg-positive individuals can introduce a substantial positive bias in drug efficacy due to regression toward the mean, particularly when infection levels or drug efficacy are low. This bias was completely eliminated by using a second baseline sample, conditionally on the first sample being excluded from analysis. Precision of estimates can be improved by increasing the number of thick smears and/or samples per person at follow-up, despite fewer individuals being tested within the same budget.We present optimized survey designs to monitor drug efficacy in field settings, which are highly relevant for sustained control of soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis, as well as onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis.},

  abstract = {Most pathogen detection tests are imperfect, with a sensitivity {$<$} 100\%, thereby resulting in the potential for a false negative, where a pathogen is present but not detected. False negatives in a sample inflate the number of non-detections, negatively biasing estimates of pathogen prevalence. Histological examination of tissues as a diagnostic test can be advantageous as multiple pathogens can be examined and providing important information on associated pathological changes to the host. However, it is usually less sensitive than molecular or microbiological tests for specific pathogens. Our study objectives were to 1) develop a hierarchical occupancy model to examine pathogen prevalence in spring Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and their distribution among host tissues 2) use the model to estimate pathogen-specific test sensitivities and infection rates, and 3) illustrate the effect of using replicate within host sampling on sample sizes required to detect a pathogen. We examined histological sections of replicate tissue samples from spring Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha collected after spawning for common pathogens seen in this population: Apophallus/ echinostome metacercariae, Parvicapsula minibicornis, Nanophyetus salmincola/ metacercariae, and Renibacterium salmoninarum. A hierarchical occupancy model was developed to estimate pathogen and tissue-specific test sensitivities and unbiased estimation of host- and organ-level infection rates. Model estimated sensitivities and host- and organ-level infections rates varied among pathogens and model estimated infection rate was higher than prevalence unadjusted for test sensitivity, confirming that prevalence unadjusted for test sensitivity was negatively biased. The modeling approach provided an analytical approach for using hierarchically structured pathogen detection data from lower sensitivity diagnostic tests, such as histology, to obtain unbiased pathogen prevalence estimates with associated uncertainties. Accounting for test sensitivity using within host replicate samples also required fewer individual fish to be sampled. This approach is useful for evaluating pathogen or microbe community dynamics when test sensitivity is {$<$}100\%. \textcopyright{} 2015, Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.},

M\'ETODOS: Foram utilizados dados de um estudo epidemiol\'ogico transversal (n=2.072), de base populacional, realizado com idosos na cidade de S\~ao Paulo (SP), entre maio de 2003 e abril de 2005. Diagn\'osticos de dem\^encia, poss\'iveis casos de transtorno mental comum e autopercep\c{c}\~ao de sa\'ude ruim foram escolhidos como desfechos com preval\^encia baixa, intermedi\'aria e alta, respectivamente. Foram utilizadas vari\'aveis de confus\~ao com duas ou mais categorias ou valores cont\'inuos. Valores de refer\^encia para estimativas por ponto e por intervalo para as raz\~oes de preval\^encia (RP) foram obtidos pelo m\'etodo de estratifica\c{c}\~ao de Mantel-Haenszel. Estimativas ajustadas foram calculadas utilizando regress\~oes de Cox e Poisson com vari\^ancia robusta, e regress\~ao log-binomial. Odds ratios (OR) brutos e ajustados foram obtidos pela regress\~ao log\'istica. RESULTADOS: As estimativas por ponto e por intervalo obtidas pelas regress\~oes de Cox e Poisson foram semelhantes \`a obtida pela estratifica\c{c}\~ao de Mantel-Haenszel, independentemente da preval\^encia do desfecho e das covari\'aveis do modelo. O modelo log-binomial apresentou dificuldade de converg\^encia quando o desfecho tinha preval\^encia alta e havia covari\'avel cont\'inua no modelo. A regress\~ao log\'istica produziu estimativas por ponto e por intervalo maiores do que as obtidas pelos outros m\'etodos, principalmente para os desfechos com maiores preval\^encias iniciais. Se interpretados como estimativas de RP, os OR superestimariam as associa\c{c}\~oes para os desfechos com preval\^encia inicial baixa, intermedi\'aria e alta em 13\%, quase 100\% e quatro vezes mais, respectivamente. CONCLUS\~OES: Em an\'alise de dados de estudos de corte transversal, os modelos de Cox e Poisson com vari\^ancia robusta s\~ao melhores alternativas que a regress\~ao log\'istica. O modelo de regress\~ao log-binomial produz estimativas n\~ao enviesadas da RP, mas pode apresentar dificuldade de converg\^encia quando o desfecho \'e muito freq\"uente e a vari\'avel de confus\~ao \'e cont\'inua.},

Nematodirus battus is one of the most important organisms that infect sheep but the distribution of parasites among hosts is unknown. An initial analysis indicated a high frequency of animals without N. battus and with zero egg counts, suggesting the possibility of a zero-inflated distribution. We developed a Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate the parameters of the zero-inflated negative binomial distribution. The analysis of 3000 simulated data sets indicated that this method out-performed the maximum likelihood procedure. Application of this technique to faecal egg counts from lambs in a commercial upland flock indicated that N. battus counts were indeed zero-inflated. Estimating the extent of zero-inflation is important for effective statistical analysis and for the accurate identification of genetically resistant animals.},

  abstract = {Obtaining inferences on disease dynamics (e.g., host population size, pathogen prevalence, transmission rate, host survival probability) typically requires marking and tracking individuals over time. While multistate mark\textendash recapture models can produce high-quality inference, these techniques are difficult to employ at large spatial and long temporal scales or in small remnant host populations decimated by virulent pathogens, where low recapture rates may preclude the use of mark\textendash recapture techniques. Recently developed N-mixture models offer a statistical framework for estimating wildlife disease dynamics from count data. N-mixture models are a type of state-space model in which observation error is attributed to failing to detect some individuals when they are present (i.e., false negatives). The analysis approach uses repeated surveys of sites over a period of population closure to estimate detection probability. We review the challenges of modeling disease dynamics and describe how N-mixture models can be used to estimate common metrics, including pathogen prevalence, transmission, and recovery rates while accounting for imperfect host and pathogen detection. We also offer a perspective on future research directions at the intersection of quantitative and disease ecology, including the estimation of false positives in pathogen presence, spatially explicit disease-structured N-mixture models, and the integration of other data types with count data to inform disease dynamics. Managers rely on accurate and precise estimates of disease dynamics to develop strategies to mitigate pathogen impacts on host populations. At a time when pathogens pose one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, statistical methods that lead to robust inferences on host populations are critically needed for rapid, rather than incremental, assessments of the impacts of emerging infectious diseases.},

  abstract = {Conservation managers rely on accurate estimates of disease parameters, such as pathogen prevalence and infection intensity, to assess disease status of a host population. However, these disease metrics may be biased if low-level infection intensities are missed by sampling methods or laboratory diagnostic tests. These false negatives underestimate pathogen prevalence and overestimate mean infection intensity of infected individuals. Our objectives were two-fold. First, we quantified false negative error rates of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) on non-invasive skin swabs collected from an amphibian community in El Cop\'e, Panama. We swabbed amphibians twice in sequence, and we used a recently developed hierarchical Bayesian estimator to assess disease status of the population. Second, we developed a novel hierarchical Bayesian model to simultaneously account for imperfect pathogen detection from field sampling and laboratory diagnostic testing. We evaluated the performance of the model, using simulations and varying sampling design to quantify the magnitude of bias in estimates of pathogen prevalence and infection intensity. We show that Bd detection probability from skin swabs was related to host infection intensity, where Bd infections {$<$}10 zoospores have {$<$}95\% probability of being detected. If imperfect Bd detection was not considered, then Bd prevalence was underestimated by as much as 71\%. In the Bd-amphibian system, this indicates a need to correct for imperfect pathogen detection in enzootic host populations persisting with low-level infections. More generally, our results have implications for study designs in other disease systems, particularly those with similar objectives, biology, and sampling decisions. Uncertainty in pathogen detection is an inherent property of most sampling protocols and diagnostic tests, where the magnitude of bias depends on the study system, type of infection, and false negative error rates. Given that it may be difficult to know this information in advance, we advocate that the most cautious approach is to assume all errors are possible and to accommodate them by adjusting sampling designs. The modelling framework presented here improves the accuracy in estimating pathogen prevalence and infection intensity.},

Two components of sample variation were simulated: selecting hosts from the general population which was modelled by the negative binomial distribution (NBD), and taking an aliquot of faeces from the selected host to estimate the worm egg count by assuming a Poisson distribution of sample counts. Geometric mean counts were determined by adding a constant (C) to each count prior to log transformation, C was set at 25, 12 or 1. Ten thousand Monte Carlo simulations were run to estimate mean efficacy, the 2.5\% (lower) and the 97.5\% (upper) percentile based on arithmetic or geometric means. Arithmetic means best estimated efficacy for all different levels of worm aggregation. For moderate levels of aggregation and with C=1 the geometric mean substantially overestimated efficacy. The bias was reduced if C was increased to 25 but the results were no better than those based on arithmetic means. For very high levels of aggregation (over-dispersed populations) the geometric mean underestimated efficacy regardless of the size of C. It is recommended that the guidelines on anthelmintic resistance be revised to advocate the use of arithmetic means to estimate efficacy.},

  abstract = {As it has been 30 years since a new anthelmintic class was released, it is appropriate to review management practices aimed at slowing the development of anthelmintic resistance to all drug classes. Recommendations to delay anthelmintic resistance, provide refugia and the use of a simulation model were reviewed to find optimum treatment strategies that maintain nematode control. Simulated Australian conditions indicated that a common successful low-risk treatment program was a rapid rotation between a ``triple-combination'' product (benzimidazole+levamisole+abamectin) and a new high-efficacy drug (monepantel). Where Haemonchus contortus was a threat, moxidectin was required at critical times because of its persistent activity against this parasite. Leaving up to 4\% of adult sheep untreated provided sufficient ``refugia'' for non-selected worms to reduce the risk of selecting for anthelmintic resistance without compromising nematode control. For a new anthelmintic, efficacy estimated by faecal egg count reduction (FECR) is likely to be at or close to 100\%, however using current methods the 95\% confidence limits (CL) for 100\% are incorrectly determined as 100\%. The fewer eggs counted pre-treatment, the more likely an estimate of 100\% will occur, particularly if the true efficacy is {$>$}90\%. A novel way to determine the lower-CL (LCL) for 100\% efficacy is to reframe FECR as a binomial proportion, i.e. define: n and x as the total number of eggs counted (rather than eggs per gram of faeces) for all pre-treatment and post-treatment animals, respectively; p the proportion of resistant eggs is p=x/n and percent efficacy is 100\texttimes (1-p) (assuming equal treatment group sizes and detection levels, pre- and post-treatment). The LCL is approximated from the cumulative inverse beta distribution by: 95\%LCL=100\texttimes (1-(BETAINV(0.975, x+1, n-x+1))). This method is simpler than the current method, independent of the number of animals tested, and demonstrates that for 100\% efficacy at least 37 eggs (not eggs per gram) need to be counted pre-treatment before the LCL can exceed 90\%. When nematode aggregation is high, this method can be usefully applied to efficacy estimates lower than 100\%, and in this case the 95\% upper-CL (UCL) can be estimated by: 95\%UCL=100\texttimes (1((BETAINV(0.025, x+1, n-x+1))), with the LCL approximated as described above. A simulation study to estimate the precision and accuracy of this method found that the more conservative 99\%CL was optimum; in this case 0.975 and 0.025 are replaced by 0.995 and 0.005 to estimate the LCL and UCL, respectively.},

However, numerous studies have suggested that the sensitivity of KK can be problematic, especially in low prevalence and low intensity settings. An emerging alternative is quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Methods:\hspace{0.6em} In this study, both KK and qPCR were conducted on stool samples from 648 participants in an STH epidemiology study conducted in the delta region of Myanmar in June 2016. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Prevalence of any STH was 20.68\% by KK and 45.06\% by qPCR. Prevalence of each individual STH was also higher by qPCR than KK, the biggest difference was for hookworm with an approximately 4-fold increase between the two diagnostic techniques. Prevalence of Ancylostoma ceylanicum, a parasite predominately found in dogs, was 4.63\%, indicating that there is the possibility of zoonotic transmission in the study setting. In individuals with moderate to high intensity infections there is evidence for a linear relationship between eggs per gram (EPG) of faeces, derived from KK, and DNA copy number, derived from qPCR which is particularly strong for Ascaris lumbricoides. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} The use of qPCR in low prevalence settings is important to accurately assess the epidemiological situation and plan control strategies for the `end game'. However, more work is required to accurately assess STH intensity from qPCR results and to reduce the cost of qPCR so that is widely accessible in STH endemic countries.},

  abstract = {Often, the prevalence of an infection in the animal-production sector is determined at the group level. The prevalence at animal level (p) gives more-precise information on the infection status of the sector. This paper shows that pooled-sample data together with mathematical models allow for estimation of p. For this, model assumptions have to be made on the variation of p between groups separated in space and/or time. Formulas were derived for four models that were based on different assumptions. Model 1 assumed that p has the same value for all groups. Models 2-4 assumed that some of the groups were not infected. In addition, model 2 assumed that p has the same value for all infected groups; model 3 assumed that for an infected group, p is equal to either p(1) or p(2); and model 4 assumed that p was Beta distributed among infected groups. The models were applied to data sets on Salmonella infection in broiler flocks, including serotype data dominated by S. Hadar and S. Paratyphi B, var. Java. Based on likelihood-ratio tests, models 3 and 4 consistently fitted significantly better to the data. The applicability of model 4 is numerically bounded, related to the shape of the Beta distribution of p. Model calculations show that flock-level prevalence of Salmonella is much higher after than before slaughter. This difference (which possibly is related to different types of samples) is much smaller at the animal level. An important result of the estimation of p is that it in turn allows for an estimation of the proportion of false-negative groups--which is important in estimating the effect of veterinary or public-health measures.},

We also investigate modifications that could be made to the current WHO treatment guidelines, and project their potential impacts in achieving morbidity and transmission control. Results While the standard guidelines are sufficient at low transmission levels, community-wide treatment (ie, involving pre-SAC, SAC, and adults) is essential if WHO morbidity goals are to be met in moderate- to high-transmission settings. Moreover, removing the recommendation of decreasing the treatment frequency at midline (5\textendash 6 years after the start of MDA) further improves the likelihood of achieving morbidity control in SAC. Conclusions We meld analyses based on 2 mathematical models of parasite transmission and control by MDA for the dominant STH species, to generate a unified treatment approach applicable across all settings, regardless of which STH infection is most common. We recommend clearly defined changes to the current WHO guidelines.},

  abstract = {Background: Various methods exist for statistical inference about a prevalence that consider misclassifications due to an imperfect diagnostic test. However, traditional methods are known to suffer from truncation of the prevalence estimate and the confidence intervals constructed around the point estimate, as well as from under-performance of the confidence intervals' coverage. Methods: In this study, we used simulated data sets to validate a Bayesian prevalence estimation method and compare its performance to frequentist methods, i.e. the Rogan-Gladen estimate for prevalence, RGE, in combination with several methods of confidence interval construction. Our performance measures are (i) error distribution of the point estimate against the simulated true prevalence and (ii) coverage and length of the confidence interval, or credible interval in the case of the Bayesian method. Results: Across all data sets, the Bayesian point estimate and the RGE produced similar error distributions with slight advantages of the former over the latter. In addition, the Bayesian estimate did not suffer from the RGE's truncation problem at zero or unity. With respect to coverage performance of the confidence and credible intervals, all of the traditional frequentist methods exhibited strong under-coverage, whereas the Bayesian credible interval as well as a newly developed frequentist method by Lang and Reiczigel performed as desired, with the Bayesian method having a very slight advantage in terms of interval length. Conclusion: The Bayesian prevalence estimation method should be prefered over traditional frequentist methods. An acceptable alternative is to combine the Rogan-Gladen point estimate with the Lang-Reiczigel confidence interval.},

  abstract = {Background. Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are among the most common neglected tropical diseases widely distributed in tropical countries with poor socioeconomic development. Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm are the three major STHs. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of STHs and associated risk factors among schoolchildren in selected primary schools around Lake Tana, Northwestern Ethiopia. Methods. A school-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February to May 2021 involving 337 study participants. A systematic random sampling method was utilized to select the study participants from the selected schools. Data related to sociodemographic characteristics of the study participants and risk factors for STH infections were collected using a pretested questionnaire. Stool samples were collected in sterile plastic containers from each participant and processed using Kato\textendash Katz thick fecal smear and Ritchie's concentration techniques. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software tool version 23, and factors with a were considered as statistically significant. Results. The overall prevalence of STH infection was 38.3\% (95\% CI: 33.1\textendash 43.7). Hookworm infection was the predominant STH infection, which was detected in 26.1\% schoolchildren followed by A. lumbricoides (14.8\%) and T. trichiura (1.5\%). Most of the study subjects (34.1\%) had single infections, whereas only 4.2\% study subjects had multiple helminthic infections. Among the risk factors considered in the study, lack of shoe wearing habit (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=29.5; 95\% confidence interval [CI]=6.59\textendash 132.55; ), lack of knowledge on the prevention and control methods (; 95\% CI = 2.44\textendash 11.98; ), engagement in irrigation activities (; 95\% CI = 1.02\textendash 4.57,), lack of toilet (; 95\% CI = 1.31\textendash 7.16;), children grades of 5\textendash 8 (; 95\% CI = 1.26\textendash 5.43; ), playing on soils (; 95\% CI = 2.79\textendash 12.49; ), lack of fingernail trimming habit (; 95\% CI = 1.57\textendash 6.55; ), and male gender (; 95\% CI: 1.19\textendash 4.39;) were significant explanatory factors for STH infection among schoolchildren in the study area. Conclusions. The present study showed that STHs were common among schoolchildren around Lake Tana. Therefore, education on personal and environmental hygiene should be taken into account to reduce the prevalence of STH infection in the study area.},

  abstract = {The sum of Akaike weights (SW) is often used to quantify relative variable importance (RVI) within the information-theoretic (IT) multimodel inference framework. A recent study (Galipaud et al. 2014, Methods in Ecology and Evolution 5: 983) questioned the validity of the SW approach. Regrettably, this study is flawed because SW was evaluated with an inappropriate benchmark. Irrespective of this study's methodological issues, RVI metrics based on the relative contribution of explanatory variables in explaining the variance in the response variable (partitioned R2-based) are lacking in multimodel inference. We re-evaluated the validity of SW by repeating Galipaud et al.'s experiment but with an appropriate benchmark. When explanatory variables are uncorrelated, the quantity that SW estimates (i.e. the probability that a variable is included in the actual best IT model) is monotonically related to squared zero-order correlation coefficients (r2) between explanatory variables and the response variable. The degree of correspondence between SW and r2 rankings (not values) of variables in data sets with uncorrelated explanatory variables was therefore used as a benchmark to evaluate the validity of SW as a RVI metric. To address the lack of partitioned R2-based RVI metrics in multimodel inference, we proposed 2 metrics: (a) Iweighted, the average model probability-weighted partitioned R2; and (b) Ibest, the partitioned R2 derived from the best IT model. We performed Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the utility of Iweighted and Ibest versus partitioned R2 derived from the global model (Iglobal). SW rankings matched r2 rankings of variables; therefore, SW is a valid measure of RVI. Among partitioned R2-based metrics, Iweighted and Iglobal were generally more accurate in estimating the population partitioned R2. Iweighted performed better when explanatory variables were uncorrelated, whereas Iglobal was better in smaller data sets with correlated explanatory variables. To improve the utility of Iweighted in such data sets, we proposed approaches to eliminate or reduce the influence of correlated variables. Despite recent criticisms, our results show that SW is a valid RVI metric. To quantify RVI in terms of the R2 explained by each variable, Iweighted and Iglobal are the preferred RVI metrics.},

  abstract = {A simple random survey was conducted in Ireland during 2005 to estimate the ELISA-prevalence of paratuberculosis, commonly called Johne's disease (JD), in the cattle population. Serum samples were collected from all 20,322 females/breeding bulls over 12 months-of-age in 639 herds. All samples were tested using a commercially available absorbed ELISA. The overall prevalence of infected herds, based on the presence of at least one ELISA-positive animal, was 21.4\% (95\% CI 18.4\%-24.9\%). Herd prevalence levels amongst dairy herds (mean 31.5\%; 95\% CI: 24.6\%, 39.3\%) was higher than among beef herds (mean 17.9\%; 95\% CI: 14.6\%-21.8\%). However, the animal level prevalence was similar. The true prevalence among all animals tested, was calculated to be 2.86\% (95\%CI: 2.76, 2.97) and for animals {$>$}= 2 yrs, it was 3.30\% (95\%CI: 3.17, 3.43). For animals in beef herds, true prevalence was 3.09\% (95\%CI: 2.93, 3.24), and for those in dairy herds, 2.74\% (95\%CI: 2.59, 2.90). The majority of herds had only one ELISA-positive infected animal. Only 6.4\% (95\% CI 4.7\%-8.7\%) of all herds had more than one ELISA-positive infected animal; 13.3\% (CI 8.7\%-19.7\%) of dairy herds ranging from two to eight ELISA-positive infected animals; and, 3.9\% beef herds (CI 2.4\%-6.2\%) ranging from two to five ELISA-positive infected animals. The true prevalence of herds infected and shedding Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis is estimated to be 9.5\% for all herd types; 20.6\% for dairy herds; and 7.6\% for beef herds. If ELISA positive animals {$<$}2-years-of-age are excluded, the true herd prevalene reduces to: 9.3\% for all herd types; 19.6\% for dairy herds; and 6.3\% for beef herds based on a test specificity (Sp) of 99.8\% and test sensitivity (Se) (i.e., ability to detect culture-positive, infected animals shedding at any level) of 27.8-28.9\%.},

The World Health Organization has set thresholds of observed prevalence that require intervention to reach the goal of eliminating schistosomiasis as a public health problem by 2025. Intervention thresholds are defined based on parasitologic methods, which is urine filtration for Schistosoma haematobium. There are alternative diagnostic methods to detect S. haematobium, such as the detection of blood in urine that is a common symptom of urogenital schistosomiasis. We determined the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of a reagent strip to detect microhematuria using data from two villages in Tanzania at multiple time points (once before and several times after treatment with the deworming drug praziquantel) and translate the urine filtration intervention thresholds to reagent strip equivalents. We show that the reagent strip including trace results is almost perfectly sensitive for infections above 15 eggs of S. haematobium per 10 ml of urine and that a 10\% observed prevalence by urine filtration corresponds to 17.6\% observed prevalence by reagent strip including traces.},

Already moderate infection intensities can impair cognitive and physical development of children, and reduce fertility in women of reproductive age. The World Health Organization set the global target to eliminate morbidity due to hookworm infections in preschool-age and school-age children by 2030. To reach this goal, different public health interventions are carried out. The most widely used strategy is mass drug administration. To assess the efficacy of treatments, epidemiologic studies and clinical trials usually employ the Kato-Katz thick smear technique to microscopically examine stool samples of individuals before and after treatment. Of note, this diagnostic test is not 100\% accurate such that not all positive individuals are detected. We developed a mathematical model, which takes into account the diagnostic error to compare the `true' efficacy of different drugs and treatment regimens against hookworm infection. Furthermore, we computed how well the test detects infected individuals in relation to infection intensity. We found that the diagnostic sensitivity of the Kato-Katz thick smear technique increases considerably if two stool specimens from different days are collected and multiple Kato-Katz thick smears are analyzed instead of one.},

Considering both public and animal health, providing consolidated prevalence data could be relevant within the decision process of public policy makers or producers organizations. The objective of this study was to conduct a critical review of the literature focused on the prevalence of C. burnetii infection at animal, herd and within-herd levels in cattle, goat and sheep. A qualitative assessment of the 69 selected publications, based on the analysis of the sampling frame and testing procedures, was also performed. While the number of publications increased recently, major methodological issues were still evidenced. These critical issues were related to (i) the absence of description of the sampling strategy and (ii) the lack of sensitivity of the testing procedure. The lack of well designed studies makes not possible to estimate accurately the current prevalence of the infection. Nevertheless, the literature review reported the detection of C. burnetii infection in the all 5 continents with a wide range whatever the species. The apparent prevalence was slightly higher in cattle (20.0\% and 37.7\% of mean apparent prevalence at animal and herd level respectively) than in small ruminants (around 15.0\% and 25\% respectively for animal and herd level in sheep and goat). The present conclusions and the current situation support the persistent need of conducting well designed studies, aiming at estimating the true prevalence of C. burnetii infection in the three main domestic ruminant species.},

  abstract = {Accurate knowledge of species occurrence is fundamental to a wide variety of ecological, evolutionary and conservation applications. Assessing the presence or absence of species at sites is often complicated by imperfect detection, with different mechanisms potentially contributing to false-negative and/or false-positive errors at different sampling stages. Ambiguities in the data mean that estimation of relevant parameters might be confounded unless additional information is available to resolve those uncertainties. Here, we consider the analysis of species detection data with false-positive and false-negative errors at multiple levels. We develop and examine a two-stage occupancy-detection model for this purpose. We use profile likelihoods for identifiability analysis and estimation, and study the types of additional data required for reliable estimation. We test the model with simulated data, and then analyse data from environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys of four Australian frog species. In our case study, we consider that false positives may arise due to contamination at the water sample and quantitative PCR-sample levels, whereas false negatives may arise due to eDNA not being captured in a field sample, or due to the sensitivity of laboratory tests. We augment our eDNA survey data with data from aural surveys and laboratory calibration experiments. We demonstrate that the two-stage model with false-positive and false-negative errors is not identifiable if only survey data prone to false positives are available. At least two sources of extra information are required for reliable estimation (e.g. records from a survey method with unambiguous detections, and a calibration experiment). Alternatively, identifiability can be achieved by setting plausible bounds on false detection rates as prior information in a Bayesian setting. The results of our case study matched our simulations with respect to data requirements, and revealed false-positive rates greater than zero for all species. We provide statistical modelling tools to account for uncertainties in species occurrence survey data when false negatives and false positives could occur at multiple sampling stages. Such data are often needed to support management and policy decisions. Dealing with these uncertainties is relevant for traditional survey methods, but also for promising new techniques, such as eDNA sampling. \textcopyright{} 2017 The Authors.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Results from a Belgium-wide survey of Campylobacter contamination in chicken meat preparations (n = 656 samples) showed that Campylobacter was detected in 24.2\% of the samples by enrichment, compared with 41\% detected by direct plating. Combining positive results from both methods increased the apparent prevalence to 48.02\%. Bayesian model was set up in WinBUGS software, the model estimates Campylobacter prevalence as 60\% (95\% Credibility interval (CI): 47-82\%), and the sensitivity of enrichment culture and direct plating as 41\% (95\% CI: 31-52\%) and 69\% (95\% CI: 50-85\%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The parallel use of direct plating and enrichment culture adds value for Campylobacter detection from chicken meat preparations, but the false-negative results from each culture method must be taken into account. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Monitoring data could be strongly biased by the microbiological techniques used to generate it.

  abstract = {Although the prevalence of helminths infection among schoolchildren is known, there has been little progress in the application of count model for modelling the risk factors of helminths egg. Only a few studies applied multilevel analysis to explore the variation in helminths prevalence across schools and classes. This study aimed to assess the prevalence, intensity of helminths infection, and identify risk factors at the individual-, household-, and school-level among schoolchildren in Southern Ethiopia. Using multistage random sampling, we recruited 864 students in the Wonago District. We applied multilevel-logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models (ZINB). Risk factors were concentrated at the individual level; school-level and class-level variables explained less than 5\% of the variance. The overall helminths prevalence was 56\% (479/850); Trichuris trichiura prevalence was 42.4\% (360/850); and Ascaris lumbricoides prevalence was 18.7\% (159/850). The rate of any helminths increased among thin children (AOR: 1.73 [95\% CI: (1.04, 2.90]), anemic (AOR: 1.45 [95\% CI: 1.04, 2.03]), mothers who had no formal education (AOR: 2.08 [95\% CI: 1.25, 3.47]), and those in households using open containers for water storage (AOR: 2.06 [95\% CI: 1.07, 3.99]). In the ZINB model, A. lumbricoides infection intensity increased with increasing age (AOR: 1.08 [95\% CI: 1.01, 1.16]) and unclean fingernails (AOR: 1.47 [95\% CI: 1.07, 2.03]). Handwashing with soap (AOR: 0.68 [95\% CI: 0.48, 0.95]), de-worming treatment [AOR: 0.57 (95\% CI: 0.33, 0.98)], and using water from protected sources [AOR: 0.46 (95\% CI: 0.28, 0.77)] were found to be protective against helminths infection. After controlling for clustering effects at the school and class levels and accounting for excess zeros in fecal egg counts, we found an association between helminths infection and the following variables: age, thinness, anemia, unclean fingernails, handwashing, de-worming treatment, mother's education, household water source, and water storage protection. Improving hygiene behavior, providing safe water at school and home, and strengthening de-worming programs is required to improve the health of schoolchildren in rural Gedeo., Helminth infections are common among school-aged children in Ethiopia. Several cross-sectional studies have investigated the risk factors of these helminths infection. However, most were conducted in an urban setting in Northern Ethiopia. Many of these studies did not report the intensity of helminth infections; and they restricted helminths infection data to binary outcomes. There has been limited report related to zero-inflated model for helminths count data with excess zeros and over-dispersion. Multilevel analysis for nested structure of school data has also been rarely applied. Therefore, we aimed to assess the prevalence and intensity of helminths infection and the related individual-, household-, and school-level risk factors among rural schoolchildren in Southern Ethiopia. Using count model, we modelled the risk factors of helminths egg. Using a multivariate, multilevel, mixed-effect, logistic regression model, we found minimal variation across class- and school-level factors for helminths infection prevalence. We found associations between helminths infection and most individual-, and some household-level factors. Therefore, interventions focusing on the individual, household, and school should be implemented to reduce the prevalence of infection and worm load among schoolchildren.},

  abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are broadly applicable hierarchical models that derive their utility from separating state processes from observation processes yielding the data. Multistate models such as mark\textendash recapture and dynamic multistate occupancy models are HMMs frequently used in ecology. In their early formulations, states, such as pathogen infection status, were assumed to be perfectly observed without ambiguity. However, state uncertainty is a pervasive feature of many ecological studies, and multievent models were developed to explicitly account for it. We developed a novel extended multievent mark\textendash recapture model that incorporates state uncertainty at multiple levels of detection. Using a disease-structured example, both false negative and false positive state assignment errors are modelled at two levels of state assignment\textemdash the pathogen sampling process and the diagnostic process that samples are subjected to. We additionally describe methods to jointly model infection intensity to integrate heterogeneity in ecological parameters, such as mortality and infection dynamics, and the pathogen detection processes. We provide code to simulate and analyse datasets with various underlying ecological processes and fit our model to a mark\textendash recapture dataset of Mixophyes fleayi (Fleay's barred frog) infected with the amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Bd). In our case study, we found evidence for various state assignment errors: the sampling protocol performed poorly in detecting Bd, pathogen detection was highly dependent on infection intensity and false positives were non-negligible. Incorporating state uncertainty yielded significantly higher estimates of infection prevalence and 4\textendash 5 times lower rates of infection state transitions compared to those obtained from a traditional multistate model. Our results highlight that incorporating state assignment errors improves inference on the ecological process, especially when sensitivity and specificity of the state assignment processes are low. The general model structure can be applied to other HMMs, providing a foundation for modelling state uncertainty in related models. For disease-structured multistate models, we recommend conducting robust design surveys and collecting samples during each capture event to facilitate incorporating pathogen detection errors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is a common helminthic infection in the tropics and subtropics, particularly in sub-Saharan African countries including Ethiopia. In these counties, Schistosoma mansoni infection is a significant public health problem due to the risk of reinfection and recurrent disease despite implementing several rounds preventive chemotherapy. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at assessing the pooled prevalence of schistosomiasis in Ethiopia. METHODS: The PRISMA guidelines were followed to perform the systematic review and meta-analysis. Published studies from January 1999 to June 2020 were searched in Medline, PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, HINARI, and Cochrane Library using key words including: "prevalence", "incidence", "schistosomiasis" "Bilharziasis", "Bilharzia", "S. mansoni ", "Ethiopia". Heterogeneity of included studies was assessed using Cochran's Q test and I2 test statistics while publication bias was assessed using Egger's test. RESULTS: Ninety-four studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of S. mansoni in Ethiopia was 18.0\% (95\%CI: 14.0-23.0). The southern region of Ethiopia had a higher S. mansoni prevalence of 25.9\% (995\% CI, 14.9-41.1) than the national prevalence. The burden of S. mansoni infection was also higher than the national average in rural areas and among men with pooled prevalence of 20.2\% (95\% CI, 13.2-28.5) and 28.5\% (95\%CI, 22.7,35.1), respectively. The trend analysis showed that the prevalence of S. mansoni infection in Ethiopia decreased over the past 15\,years, potentially because of the repeated preventive chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: The review unveiled a moderate prevalence of S. mansoni infection in Ethiopia. Targeted treatment of at-risk population groups ad high burden areas coupled with implementation of integrated vector control strategies are critical to address the burden of Schistosomiasis.},

It was subsequently pointed out that such inferences will not necessarily be accurate in the sense that standard errors for parameters may not decrease as n increases. This problem will generally occur when the data are insufficient to estimate all of the parameters as is the case when screening a single population with two tests. If both tests are applied to units sampled from two populations, however, this particular difficulty disappears. In this article the authors further examine this issue and develop an approach based on sampling two populations that yields increasingly accurate inferences as the sample size increases.},

  abstract = {Symbiont occurrence is influenced by host occurrence and vice versa, which leads to correlations in host-symbiont distributions at multiple levels. Interactions between co-infecting symbionts within host individuals can cause correlations in the abundance of two symbiont species across individual hosts. Similarly, interactions between symbiont transmission and host population dynamics can drive correlations between symbiont and host abundance across habitat patches. If ignored, these interactions can confound estimated responses of hosts and symbionts to other factors. Here, we present a general hierarchical modeling framework for distributions of hosts and symbionts, estimating correlations in host-symbiont distributions at the among-site, within-site, among-species, and amongindividual levels. We present an empirical example from a multi-host multi-parasite system involving amphibians and their micro- and macroparasites. Amphibian hosts and their parasites were correlated at multiple levels of organization. Macroparasites often co-infected individual hosts, but rarely co-infected with the amphibian chytrid fungus. Such correlations may result from interactions among parasites and hosts, joint responses to environmental factors, or sampling bias. Joint host-symbiont models account for environmental constraints and species interactions while partitioning variance and dependence in abundance at multiple levels. This framework can be adapted to a wide variety of study systems and sampling designs. \textcopyright{} 2016 Joseph et al.

In the present study we evaluated this pooling strategy for the assessment of intensity of both STH and Schistosoma mansoni infections using the Kato-Katz technique. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 360 children aged 5\textendash 18 years from six schools in Jimma Zone (southwest Ethiopia). We performed faecal egg counts (FECs) in both individual and pooled samples (pools sizes of 5, 10 and 20) to estimate the number of eggs per gram of stool (EPG) using the Kato-Katz technique. We also assessed the time to screen both individual and pooled samples. Results: Except for hookworms, there was a significant correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.53\textendash 0.95) between the mean of individual FECs and the FECs of pooled samples for A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura and S. mansoni, regardless of the pool size. Mean FEC were 2,596 EPG, 125 EPG, 47 EPG, and 41 EPG for A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, S. mansoni and hookworm, respectively. There was no significant difference in FECs between the examination of individual and pooled stool samples, except for hookworms. For this STH, pools of 10 resulted in a significant underestimation of infection intensity. The total time to obtain individual FECs was 65 h 5 min. For pooled FECs, this was 19 h 12 min for pools of 5, 14 h 39 min for pools of 10 and 12 h 42 min for pools of 20. Conclusions: The results indicate that pooling of stool sample holds also promise as a rapid assessment of infections intensity for STH and S. mansoni using the Kato-Katz technique. In this setting, the time in the laboratory was reduced by 70 \% when pools of 5 instead of individual stool samples were screened.},

  abstract = {Wildlife diseases have important implications for wildlife and human health, the preservation of biodiversity and the resilience of ecosystems. However, understanding disease dynamics and the impacts of pathogens in wild populations is challenging because these complex systems can rarely, if ever, be observed without error. Uncertainty in disease ecology studies is commonly defined in terms of either heterogeneity in detectability (due to variation in the probability of encountering, capturing, or detecting individuals in their natural habitat) or uncertainty in disease state assignment (due to misclassification errors or incomplete information). In reality, however, uncertainty in disease ecology studies extends beyond these components of observation error and can arise from multiple varied processes, each of which can lead to bias and a lack of precision in parameter estimates. Here, we present an inventory of the sources of potential uncertainty in studies that attempt to quantify disease-relevant parameters from wild populations (e.g., prevalence, incidence, transmission rates, force of infection, risk of infection, persistence times, and disease-induced impacts). We show that uncertainty can arise via processes pertaining to aspects of the disease system, the study design, the methods used to study the system, and the state of knowledge of the system, and that uncertainties generated via one process can propagate through to others because of interactions between the numerous biological, methodological and environmental factors at play. We show that many of these sources of uncertainty may not be immediately apparent to researchers (for example, unidentified crypticity among vectors, hosts or pathogens, a mismatch between the temporal scale of sampling and disease dynamics, demographic or social misclassification), and thus have received comparatively little consideration in the literature to date. Finally, we discuss the type of bias or imprecision introduced by these varied sources of uncertainty and briefly present appropriate sampling and analytical methods to account for, or minimise, their influence on estimates of disease-relevant parameters. This review should assist researchers and practitioners to navigate the pitfalls of uncertainty in wildlife disease ecology studies. \textcopyright{} 2018 Lachish and Murray.},

We review statistical methods to account for such errors in the analysis of eDNA data and use simulations to compare the performance of different modelling approaches.

We further show that removing or classifying single PCR detections in an ad hoc manner under the suspicion that such records represent false positives, as sometimes advocated in the eDNA literature, also results in biased estimation of occupancy, detectability and false-positive rates. We advocate alternative approaches to account for false-positive errors that rely on prior information, or the collection of ancillary detection data at a subset of sites using a sampling method that is not prone to false-positive errors. We illustrate the advantages of these approaches over ad hoc classifications of detections and provide practical advice and code for fitting these models in maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks. Given the severe bias induced by false-negative and false-positive errors, the methods presented here should be more routinely adopted in eDNA studies.},

  abstract = {Background Laboratory-based studies have highlighted that pooling stool and urine samples can reduce costs and diagnostic burden without a negative impact on the ability to estimate the intensity of soil-transmitted helminth (STH, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworms) and schistosome infections (Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium). In this study, we compare individual and pooled stool examination strategies in a programmatic setting. Methods Stool samples were collected from 2,650 children in 53 primary schools in Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia, during the national mapping of STHs and schistosome infections. Eggs of STHs and S. mansoni were quantified in both individual and pooled samples (pools were made from 10 individual samples) using a single Kato-Katz smear. Principal findings A pooled diagnostic examination strategy provided comparable estimates of infection intensity with higher fecal egg count (expressed in eggs per gram of stool (EPG)) than those based on individual strategy (Ascaris: 45.1 EPG vs. 93.9, p = 0.03; Trichuris: 1.8 EPG vs. 2.1 EPG, p = 0.95; hookworms: 17.5 EPG vs. 28.5 EPG, p = 0.18; S. mansoni: 1.6 EPG vs. 3.4 EPG, p = 0.02), but had lower sensitivity (Ascaris: 90.0\% vs. 55.0\%; Trichuris: 91.7\% vs. 16.7\%; hookworms: 92.6\% vs. 61.8\%; S. mansoni: 100\% vs. 51.7\%, p {$<$} 0.001). A pooled approach resulted in a \textasciitilde 70\% reduction in time required for sample testing, but reduced total operational costs by only \textasciitilde 11\%. Conclusions/Significance A pooled approach holds promise for the rapid assessment of intensity of helminth infections in a programmatic setting, but it is not major cost-saving strategy. Further investigation is required to determine when and how pooling can be utilized. Such work should also include validation of statistical methods to estimate prevalence based on pooling samples. Finally, the comparison of operational costs across different scenarios of national program management will help determine whether pooling is indeed worthwhile considering.},

  abstract = {Currently, in public health, the reduction in the number of eggs excreted in stools after drug administration is used to monitor the efficacy of drugs against parasitic worms. Yet, studies comparing diagnostic methods for the enumeration of eggs in stool are few. We compared the Kato-Katz thick smear (Kato-Katz) and McMaster egg counting (McMaster) methods, which are commonly used diagnostic methods in public and animal health, respectively, for the diagnosis and enumeration of eggs of roundworms, whipworms and hookworms in 1,536 stool samples from children in five trials across Africa, Asia and South America. The Kato-Katz method was the most sensitive for the detection of roundworms, but there was no significant difference in sensitivity between the methods for hookworms and whipworms. The sensitivity of the methods differed across the trials and magnitude of egg counts. The Kato-Katz method resulted in significantly higher egg counts, but these were subject to lack of accuracy caused by intrinsic properties of this method. McMaster provided more reliable estimates of drug efficacies. We conclude that the McMaster is an alternative method for monitoring large-scale treatment programs. It allows accurate monitoring of drug efficacy and can be easily performed under field conditions.},

From this general framework, we discuss how to calculate a sample size for assessing a population mean FEC and the impact of an intervention, measured as reduction in FECs, for any scenario of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) epidemiology (the intensity and aggregation of FECs within a population) and diagnostic strategy (amount of stool examined (wsensitivity of the diagnostic technique) and examination of individual/pooled stool samples) and on how to estimate prevalence of STH in the absence of a gold standard.

  abstract = {Imperfect detectability in animal studies has been an acknowledged problem for several decades. A number of analytical approaches (e.g., capture-mark-recapture, distance sampling, occupancy analyses), have been developed to deal with the problem and estimate biological parameters of interest. These different analytical approaches can be implemented through various software programs, each with its own graphical user interface (GUI), data input format, and graphing capabilities. Although GUIs and mouse clicks might be convenient to conduct analyses, mouse clicks are difficult to replicate and archive in the long term. Using programming environments such as the R open source project along with a text editor yields flexibility and leaves a paper trail after the analyses are conducted. Such environments also provide statistical and graphical tools for further treatment following the analyses. In this article, I use R to conduct classical analyses to estimate demographic parameters in four case studies. The examples feature interacting with certain software such as MARK, as well as using recent R packages designed to implement specific analyses in both a frequentist and a Bayesian framework. The case studies present all the steps to conduct the analyses, including data importation, model selection, and multimodel inference, as well as the graphical presentation of results. Such an integrative approach provides a flexible alternative to using GUIs, while keeping everything in the same environment and documenting precisely how an analysis was conducted. These are the basic ideas behind reproducible research. On reconna\^it depuis plusieurs d\'ecennies le probl\`eme de la probabilit\'e de d\'etection imparfaite lors de l'\'etude de populations animales. Afin d'aborder le probl\`eme et d'estimer les param\`etres biologiques d'int\'er\^et, plusieurs approches analytiques ont \'et\'e d\'evelopp\'ees, telles que les approches de capture-marquage-recapture, l'\'echantillonnage de la distance et les analyses d'occupation de sites.

  abstract = {Background: In veterinary parasitology samples are often pooled for a rapid assessment of infection intensity and drug efficacy. Currently, studies evaluating this strategy in large-scale drug administration programs to control human soiltransmitted helminths (STHs; Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm), are absent. Therefore, we developed and evaluated a pooling strategy to assess intensity of STH infections and drug efficacy. Methods/Principal Findings: Stool samples from 840 children attending 14 primary schools in Jimma, Ethiopia were pooled (pool sizes of 10, 20, and 60) to evaluate the infection intensity of STHs. In addition, the efficacy of a single dose of mebendazole (500 mg) in terms of fecal egg count reduction (FECR; synonym of egg reduction rate) was evaluated in 600 children from two of these schools. Individual and pooled samples were examined with the McMaster egg counting method. For each of the three STHs, we found a significant positive correlation between mean fecal egg counts (FECs) of individual stool samples and FEC of pooled stool samples, ranging from 0.62 to 0.98. Only for A. lumbricoides was any significant difference in mean FEC of the individual and pooled samples found. For this STH species, pools of 60 samples resulted in significantly higher FECs. FECR for the different number of samples pooled was comparable in all pool sizes, except for hookworm. For this parasite, pools of 10 and 60 samples provided significantly higher FECR results. Conclusion/Significance: This study highlights that pooling stool samples holds promise as a strategy for rapidly assessing infection intensity and efficacy of administered drugs in programs to control human STHs. However, further research is required to determine when and how pooling of stool samples can be cost-effectively applied along a control program, and to verify whether this approach is also applicable to other NTDs.},

  abstract = {The strategy of the World Health Organization (WHO) to combat schistosomiasis is based on administering praziquantel as preventive chemotherapy to school-age children only, or including adults. For Schistosoma haematobium the treatment decision is based on observed prevalence by urine filtration which involves counting eggs under a light microscope. Urine filtration is time intensive and requires trained technicians to operate the microscope. Blood in urine is a common symptom of urogenital schistosomiasis and therefore, the use of screening tools based on the detection of hematuria has been suggested. We analyze three such screening tools, namely reagent strip to detect microhematuria, a questionnaire regarding recent history of blood in urine, and visible inspection of urine and determine their diagnostic accuracy to evaluate treatment need at district level in comparison to urine filtration in a national survey in Zimbabwe. We find that both the questionnaire and reagent strip classify districts with sensitivity and specificity above 85\% at the 10\% urine filtration thresholds. Wrongly classified districts generally show urine filtration prevalence in the vicinity of the 10\% prevalence thresholds. We conclude that there is evidence that a questionnaire can be used as a low cost alternative rapid screening tool for S. haematobium.},

  abstract = {1. Epidemiological studies are crucial for understanding the distribution and dynamics of emerging infectious diseases. To accurately assess infection states in wild populations, researchers need to account for observational uncertainty. We focus on two sources of uncertainty when estimating epidemiological parameters: nondetection of infection in sampled individuals and sampling error when quantifying infection intensity for infected individuals. 2. We developed new analytical methods to simultaneously estimate prevalence and the distribution of infection intensities based on repeated sampling of individuals in the wild. The methods are an extension of those used for occupancy estimation and address both sources of observation error. At the same time, we account for heterogeneity in detection probability that results from individual variation in infection intensity. 3. We use two estimation approaches to account for detection. The first is to use the complete likelihood in a hierarchical Bayesian model and fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The second is to estimate the detection relationship using a mark\textendash recapture abundance estimator and use those results to calculate weighted estimates for prevalence and mean infection intensities. 4. We use data from a field survey of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in Illinois amphibians to test these methods. We show that detection probability using quantitative PCR is strongly related to infection intensity, measured in zoospore equivalents. Sites in the study varied greatly in estimated prevalence and to a lesser extent in mean infection intensities of infected individuals. We did not find evidence of a relationship of snout-vent-length to infection intensity or prevalence. Na\"ive estimates of prevalence that do not account for detection were less than estimates for either of our methods, which yielded similar prevalence values for most sites. 5. Uncertainty when assessing disease state is a characteristic of most diagnostic tests. The estimators presented here account for this uncertainty and thus can improve accuracy when assessing the relationship of ecological factors to prevalence and infection intensity.},

  abstract = {Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are the most widespread of the neglected tropical diseases, primarily affecting marginalized populations in low- and middle-income countries. More than one billion people are currently infected with STHs. For the control of these infections, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends an integrated approach, which includes access to appropriate sanitation, hygiene education, and preventive chemotherapy (i.e., large-scale, periodic distribution of anthelmintic drugs). Since 2010, WHO has coordinated two large donations of benzimidazoles to endemic countries. Thus far, more than 3.3 billion benzimidazole tablets have been distributed in schools for the control of STH infections, resulting in an important reduction in STH-attributable morbidity in children, while additional tablets have been distributed for the control of lymphatic filariasis. This paper (i) summarizes the progress of global STH control between 2008 to 2018 (based on over 690 reports submitted by endemic countries to WHO); (ii) provides regional and country details on preventive chemotherapy coverage; and (iii) indicates the targets identified by WHO for the next decade and the tools that should be developed to attain these targets. The main message is that STH-attributable morbidity can be averted with evidence-informed program planning, implementation, and monitoring. Caution will still need to be exercised in stopping control programs to avoid any rebound of prevalence and loss of accrued morbidity gains. Over the next decade, with increased country leadership and multi-sector engagement, the goal of eliminating STH infections as a public health problem can be achieved.},

However, their accuracy as estimators of group mean FEC is affected by the number of individual samples included, how thoroughly they are mixed, and the underlying degree of parasite aggregation between individual hosts. This paper uses a Negative Binomial model for parasite aggregation, and a Poisson model for egg distribution within faecal suspensions, in order to optimise composite FEC protocol for commercial sheep flocks. Our results suggest that faecal egg density in a well-mixed composite sample from 10 sheep (3g of faeces from each), estimated by examination of four independently filled McMaster chambers, is likely to provide an adequate estimate of group mean FEC in the majority of situations. However, extra care is needed in groups of sheep for which high levels of FEC aggregation might be expected. The implications of statistical error in FEC estimates depend on how they are used. The simulation-based approach presented here is a powerful tool for investigating the risks of error in FEC-driven treatment decisions in different situations, as well as for the statistical analysis of parasitological data in general.},

This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (``ADEMP''); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations.

  abstract = {About 1.5 billion people are infected with soil-transmitted helminths (Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Trichuris trichiura). Since morbidity correlates with the number of worms harbored by an infected individual, WHO aims to reduce moderate and heavy infections in pre- and school-aged children by 2020. The cornerstone of estimating the prevalence, assessing drug efficacy and monitoring drug resistance are accurate diagnostic tools. The currently recommended Kato-Katz, has some major disadvantages like a short processing window and low sensitivity and new diagnostic tools are needed. FECPAKG2 is an online, remote location tool developed for counting nematode eggs in sheep, cattle, equine and Camelids fecal samples. The output of the system is an image of the sample, which is saved and uploaded onto an internet cloud. This offers new options particularly for low resource settings. We tested FECPAKG2 for the first time for analyzing human stool in a randomized controlled trial. We observed a baseline sensitivity of 75.6\% for detecting A. lumbricoides, 71.5\% for hookworm and 65.8\% for T. trichiura and an increased sensitivity for moderate infection intensities. Despite lower sensitivity and egg counts, FECPAKG2 was able to correctly estimate egg reduction rates. Following further development, FECPAKG2 might become an important tool for soil-transmitted helminth control programs, epidemiological and clinical studies.},

  abstract = {Understanding the distribution of pathogens across landscapes and their prevalence within host populations is a common aim of wildlife managers. Despite the need for unbiased estimates of pathogen occurrence and prevalence for planning effective management interventions, many researchers fail to account for imperfect pathogen detection. Instead raw data are often reported, which may lead to ineffective, or even detrimental, management actions. We illustrate the utility of occupancy models for generating unbiased estimates of disease parameters by 1) providing a written tutorial describing how to fit these models in Program PRESENCE and 2) presenting a case study with the pathogen ranavirus. We analyzed ranavirus detection data from a wildlife refuge (Maryland, US) using occupancy modeling, which yields unbiased estimates of pathogen occurrence and prevalence. We found ranavirus prevalence was underestimated by up to 30\% if imperfect pathogen detection was ignored. The unbiased estimate of ranavirus prevalence in larval wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus; 0.73) populations was higher than in larval spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum; 0.56) populations. In addition, the odds of detecting ranavirus in tail samples were 6.7 times higher than detecting ranavirus in liver samples. Therefore, tail samples presented a nonlethal sampling method for ranavirus that may be able to detect early (nonsystemic) infections.},

SAC showed a high awareness of STH and recognized the importance of preventive measures and MDA. In terms of the parents of SAC and school teachers, close to half of the respondents were knowledgeable about STH and MDA. While nearly all of the participants held positive attitudes toward MDA, the respondents pointed out that school-based MDA presents severe limitations, as non-school-going children are neglected by this effort. A total of 68.3\% of all school teachers and 56.8\% of all parents of SAC found MDA efforts to be effective. \# Conclusion STH infections still remain a significant public health burden in Bangladesh.

To provide a robust global assessment of the relative performance of available diagnostic tools for the detection of soil-transmitted helminths, we conducted a meta-analysis comparing the sensitivities and the quantitative performance of the most commonly used copro-microscopic diagnostic methods for soil-transmitted helminths, namely Kato-Katz, direct microscopy, formol-ether concentration, McMaster, FLOTAC and Mini-FLOTAC. In the absence of a perfect reference standard, we employed a Bayesian latent class analysis to estimate the true, unobserved sensitivity of compared diagnostic tests for each of the soil-transmitted helminth species Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and the hookworms. To investigate the influence of varying transmission settings we subsequently stratified the analysis by intensity of infection. Overall, sensitivity estimates varied between the different methods, ranging from 42.8\% for direct microscopy to 92.7\% for FLOTAC. The widely used double slide Kato-Katz method had a sensitivity of 74\textendash 95\% for the three soil-transmitted helminth species at high infection intensity, however sensitivity dropped to 53\textendash 80\% in low intensity settings, being lowest for hookworm and A. lumbricoides. The highest sensitivity, overall and in both intensity groups, was observed for the FLOTAC method, whereas the sensitivity of the Mini-FLOTAC method was comparable with the Kato-Katz method. FLOTAC average egg count estimates were significantly lower compared with Kato-Katz, while the compared McMaster counts varied. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the Kato-Katz and Mini-FLOTAC methods had comparable sensitivities. We further show that test sensitivity of the Kato-Katz method is reduced in low transmission settings.},

Methods to estimate the true prevalence of disease, adjusting for the sensitivity and the specificity of the diagnostic tests are available and can be applied, though, such procedures can be cumbersome to researchers with or without a solid statistical background. This manuscript introduces a web-based application that integrates statistical methods for Bayesian inference of true disease prevalence based on prior elicitation for the accuracy of the diagnostic tests. This tool allows practitioners to simultaneously analyse and visualize results while using interactive sliders and output prior/posterior plots. Methods - implementation Three methods for prevalence prior elicitation and four core families of Bayesian methods have been combined and incorporated in this web tool. |tPRiors| user interface has been developed with R and Shiny and may be freely accessed on-line. Results |tPRiors| allows researchers to use preloaded data or upload their own datasets and perform analysis on either single or multiple population groups clusters, allowing, if needed, for excess zero prevalence. The final report is exported in raw parts either as.rdata or.png files and can be further analysed. We utilize a real multiple-population and a toy single-population dataset to demonstrate the robustness and capabilities of |tPRiors|. Conclusions We expect |tPRiors| to be helpful for researchers interested in true disease prevalence estimation and who are keen on accounting for prior information. |tPRiors| acts both as a statistical tool and a simplified step-by-step statistical framework that facilitates the use of complex Bayesian methods. The application of |tPRiors| is expected to aid standardization of practices in the field of Bayesian modelling on subject and multiple group-based true prevalence estimation.},

  abstract = {The relationships between host-pathogen population dynamics in wildlife are poorly understood. An impediment to progress in understanding these relationships is imperfect detection of diagnostic tests used to detect pathogens. If ignored, imperfect detection precludes accurate assessment of pathogen presence and prevalence, foundational parameters for deciphering host-pathogen dynamics and disease etiology. Respiratory disease in bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) is a significant impediment to their conservation and restoration, and effective management requires a better understanding of the structure of the pathogen communities. Our primary objective was to develop an easy-to-use and accessible web-based Shiny application that estimates the probability (with associated uncertainty) that a respiratory pathogen is present in a herd and its prevalence given imperfect detection. Our application combines the best-available information on the probabilities of detection for various respiratory pathogen diagnostic protocols with a hierarchical Bayesian model of pathogen prevalence. We demonstrated this application using four examples of diagnostic tests from three herds of bighorn sheep in Montana. For instance, one population with no detections of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae (PCR assay) still had an 6\% probability of the pathogen being present in the herd. Similarly, the apparent prevalence (0.32) of M. ovipneumoniae in another herd was a substantial underestimate of estimated true prevalence (0.46: 95\% CI = [0.25, 0.71]). The negative bias of na\"ive prevalence increased as the probability of detection of testing protocols worsened such that the apparent prevalence of Mannheimia haemolytica (culture assay) in a herd (0.24) was less than one third that of estimated true prevalence (0.78: 95\% CI = [0.43, 0.99]). We found a small difference in the estimates of the probability that Mannheimia spp. (culture assay) was present in one herd between the binomial sampling approach (0.24) and the hypergeometric approach (0.22). Ignoring the implications of imperfect detection and sampling variation for assessing pathogen communities in bighorn sheep can result in spurious inference on pathogen presence and prevalence, and potentially poorly informed management decisions. Our Shiny application makes the rigorous assessment of pathogen presence, prevalence and uncertainty straightforward, and we suggest it should be incorporated into a new paradigm of disease monitoring.},

Problems with existing methods of modeling prevalence ratios include lack of convergence, overestimated standard errors, and extrapolation of simple univariate formulas to multivariable models. We compare two of the newer methods using simulated data and real data from SAS online examples. Methods The Robust Poisson method, which uses the Poisson distribution and a sandwich variance estimator, is compared to the log-binomial method, which uses the binomial distribution to obtain maximum likelihood estimates, using computer simulations and real data. Results For very high prevalences and moderate sample size, the Robust Poisson method yields less biased estimates of the prevalence ratios than the log-binomial method. However, for moderate prevalences and moderate sample size, the log-binomial method yields slightly less biased estimates than the Robust Poisson method. In nearly all cases, the log-binomial method yielded slightly higher power and smaller standard errors than the Robust Poisson method. Conclusion Although the Robust Poisson often gives reasonable estimates of the prevalence ratio and is very easy to use, the log-binomial method results in less bias in most common situations, and because it fits the correct model and obtains maximum likelihood estimates, it generally results in slightly higher power, smaller standard errors, and, unlike the Robust Poisson, it always yields estimated prevalences between zero and one.},

  abstract = {Background Driven by global targets to eliminate soil-transmitted helminths as a public health problem, governments have rapidly rolled out control programmes using school and community-based platforms. To justify and target ongoing investment, quantification of impact and identification of remaining high-risk areas are needed. We aimed to assess regional progress towards these targets. Methods We did a continental-scale ecological analysis using a Bayesian space\textendash time hierarchical model to estimate the effects of known environmental, socioeconomic, and control-related factors on the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths, and we mapped the probability that implementation units had achieved moderate-to-heavy intensity infection prevalence of less than 2\% among children aged 5\textendash 14 years between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2018. Findings We incorporated data from 26\hphantom{,}304 georeferenced surveys, spanning 3096 (60\%) of the 5183 programmatic implementation units. Our findings suggest a reduction in the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths in children aged 5\textendash 14 years in sub-Saharan Africa, from 44\% in 2000 to 13\% in 2018, driven by sustained delivery of preventive chemotherapy, improved sanitation, and economic development. Nevertheless, 1301 (25\%) of 5183 implementation units still had an estimated prevalence of moderate-to-heavy intensity infection exceeding the 2\% target threshold in 2018, largely concentrated in nine countries (in 1026 [79\%] of 1301 implementation units): Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Angola, Mozambique, Madagascar, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. Interpretation Our estimates highlight the areas to target and strengthen interventions, and the areas where data gaps remain. If elimination of soil-transmitted helminths as a public health problem is to be achieved in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030, continued investment in treatment and prevention activities are essential to ensure that no areas are left behind.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are among the most prevalent neglected tropical diseases (NTD) worldwide. Since the publication of the WHO road map to combat NTD in 2012, there has been a renewed commitment to control STH. In this study, we analysed the geographical distribution and effect of community type on prevalence of hookworm, Trichuris and Ascaris in south Asia and south east Asia. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a systematic review of open-access literature published in PubMed Central and the Global Atlas of Helminth Infection. A total of 4182 articles were available and after applying selection criteria, 174 studies from the region were retained for analysis. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ascaris was the commonest STH identified with an overall prevalence of 18\% (95\% CI, 14-23\%) followed by Trichuris (14\%, 9-19\%) and hookworm (12\%, 9-15\%). Hookworm prevalence was highest in Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia. We found a geographical overlap in countries with high prevalence rates for Trichuris and Ascaris (Malaysia, Philippines, Myanmar, Vietnam and Bangladesh). When the effect of community type was examined, prevalence rates of hookworm was comparable in rural (19\%, 14-24\%) and tribal communities (14\%, 10-19\%). Tribal communities, however, showed higher prevalence of Trichuris (38\%, 18-63\%) and Ascaris (32\%, 23-43\%) than rural communities (13\%, 9-20\% and 14\%, 9-20\% respectively). Considerable between and within country heterogeneity in the distribution of STH (I2 {$>$}90\%) was also noted. When available data from school aged children (SAC) were analysed, prevalence of Ascaris (25\% 16-31\%) and Trichuris (22\%, 14-34\%) were higher than among the general population while that of hookworm (10\%, 7-16\%) was comparable. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our analysis showed significant variation in prevalence rates between and within countries in the region. Highlighting the importance of community type in prevalence and species mix, we showed that tribal and rural communities had higher hookworm infections than urban communities and for ascariasis and trichuriasis, tribal populations had higher levels of infection than rural populations. We also found a higher prevalence of ascariasis and trichuriasis in SAC compared to the general population but comparable levels of hookworm infections. These key findings need to be taken into account in planning future MDA and other interventions.},

  abstract = {Background: The Kato-Katz technique is widely used for the diagnosis of soil-transmitted helminthiasis in epidemiological surveys and is believed to be an inexpensive method. The FLOTAC technique shows a higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of light-intensity soil-transmitted helminth infections but is reported to be more complex and expensive. We assessed the costs related to the collection, processing and microscopic examination of stool samples using the Kato-Katz and FLOTAC techniques in an epidemiological survey carried out in Zanzibar, Tanzania. Methods: We measured the time for the collection of a single stool specimen in the field, transfer to a laboratory, preparation and microscopic examination using standard protocols for the Kato-Katz and FLOTAC techniques. Salaries of health workers, life expectancy and asset costs of materials, and infrastructure costs were determined. The average cost for a single or duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears and the FLOTAC dual or double technique were calculated. Results: The average time needed to collect a stool specimen and perform a single or duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears or the FLOTAC dual or double technique was 20 min and 34 sec (20:34 min), 27:21 min, 28:14 min and 36:44 min, respectively. The total costs for a single and duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears were US\$ 1.73 and US\$ 2.06, respectively, and for the FLOTAC double and dual technique US\$ 2.35 and US\$ 2.83, respectively. Salaries impacted most on the total costs of either method. Conclusions: The time and cost for soil-transmitted helminth diagnosis using either the Kato-Katz or FLOTAC method in epidemiological surveys are considerable. Our results can help to guide healthcare decision makers and scientists in budget planning and funding for epidemiological surveys, anthelminthic drug efficacy trials and monitoring of control interventions.},

This paper compares a number of mathematical techniques that are used to analyse data. The negative binomial distribution is a mathematical distribution used to model aggregated data and hence is suitable to model the intensity of parasite burden and the magnitude of the faecal egg counts. Maximum likelihood techniques are utilised to exploit this mathematical distribution to analyse the magnitude of the faecal egg count reduction and decline in the worm burden in response to anthelmintic treatment. Data from experimental groups of sheep described in the accompanying paper are used. In addition, simulated data sets of faecal egg counts were created using a random number generator following appropriate negative binomial distributions. The results demonstrate this statistical model can detect evidence of anthelmintic resistance with a faecal egg reduction test that otherwise might require a slaughter trial to demonstrate. In addition, the simulated data sets confirm that there is a significant probability of failure to detect low anthelmintic efficacy with commonly used mathematical techniques. Consequently, the use of maximum likelihood mathematical techniques with a negative binomial statistical model would aid in the early detection of anthelmintic resistance using faecal egg count reductions and result in a lower probability of inappropriately assigning an anthelmintic as effective.},

These include Poisson errors in the counting technique which result from eggs being randomly distributed in well mixed faecal samples. In addition, counts between animals in a single experimental or observational group are nearly always over-dispersed. We describe the R package ``eggCounts'' that we have developed that incorporates both sampling error and over-dispersion between animals to calculate the true egg counts in samples of faeces, the probability distribution of the true counts and summary statistics such as the 95\% uncertainty intervals. Based on a hierarchical Bayesian framework, the software will also rigorously estimate the percentage reduction of faecal egg counts and the 95\% uncertainty intervals of data generated by a faecal egg count reduction test. We have also developed a user friendly web interface that can be used by those with limited knowledge of the R statistical computing environment. We illustrate the package with three simulated data sets of faecal egg count reduction experiments.},

Consequently, this area has suffered from a lack of investment., The actual cost of using the Kato-Katz technique is higher and more variable than is often being assumed, and it is difficult to implement at a large scale.},

  abstract = {Surveillance of wildlife diseases is logistically difficult, and imperfect detection is a recurrent challenge for disease estimation. Using citizen science can increase sample sizes, but it is associated with a cost in terms of the anatomical type and quality of the sample. Additionally, biological tissue samples from remote areas lose quality due to autolysis. These challenges are faced in the case of emerging chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids. Here, we develop a stochastic scenario tree model of diagnostic sensitivity, allowing for a mixture of tissue sample types (lymph nodes and brain) and qualities while accounting for different detection probabilities during the CWD infection, lasting 2\textendash 3~years. We apply the diagnostic sensitivity in a Bayesian framework, enabling estimation of age-class-specific true prevalence, including the prevalence in latent, recently infected stages. We provide a simulation framework to estimate the sensitivity of the surveillance system (i.e., the probability of detecting the infection in a given population), when detectability varies among individuals due to different disease progression. We demonstrate the utility of our framework by applying it to the recent emergence of CWD in a European population of reindeer. We estimated apparent CWD prevalence at 1.2\% of adults in the infected population of wild reindeer, while the true prevalence was 1.6\%. The sensitivity estimation of the CWD surveillance was performed in an adjacent small (c. 500) and a large (c. 10,000) reindeer population, demonstrating low certainty of CWD absence. Our method has immediate application to the mandatory testing for CWD in EU countries commencing in 2018. Similar approaches that account for latent stages and a serial disease progression in various tissues with a temporal pattern of diagnostic sensitivity may enhance the estimation of the prevalence of wildlife diseases more generally. \textcopyright{} 2018 The Authors.

  abstract = {The prevalence of anthelmintic resistance has increased in recent years, as a result of the extensive use of anthelmintic drugs to reduce the infection of parasitic worms in livestock. In order to detect the resistance, the number of parasite eggs in animal faeces is counted. Typically a subsample of the diluted faeces is examined, and the mean egg counts from both untreated and treated animals are compared. However, the conventional method ignores the variabilities introduced by the counting process and by different infection levels across animals. In addition, there can be extra zero counts, which arise as a result of the unexposed animals in an infected population or animals. In this paper, we propose the zero-inflated Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate the reduction in faecal egg counts. The simulation study compares the Bayesian models with the conventional faecal egg count reduction test and other methods such as bootstrap and quasi-Poisson regression. The results show the Bayesian models are more robust and they perform well in terms of both the bias and the coverage. We further illustrate the advantages of our proposed model using a case study about the anthelmintic resistance in Swedish sheep flocks.},

In group testing, pools comprised of individual biospecimens are amalgamated and tested initially, and then the individuals belonging to positive pools are retested to complete case identification. This procedure and its variants can offer substantial savings with regard to time and testing cost. Unfortunately, these savings come at the expense of a complex data structure; e.g., ambiguities due to imperfect testing and complex dependence caused by individuals potentially being tested in multiple pools. To account for these complex features, several advanced statistical methods have been proposed. Regretfully, these methods are non-trivial to implement, especially for non-statistician. Recognizing this as an important issue in surveillance programs, we have developed a user-friendly R package called groupTesting that can be used to analyze group testing data. In particular, our package consists of R functions which possess a great deal of versatility and generality, and can be used in estimating both proportions and binary regression functions. The computing efficiency of our package is greatly enhanced through the strategic implementation of compiled Fortran subroutines. The primary features of the R package are illustrated using HIV and chlamydia data.},

The outcomes of our work can be used in designing pooled testing protocols, not only in simple pooling scenarios but also in more complex scenarios where individual retesting is performed in order to identify positive cases.

  abstract = {In recent years, an increased focus has been placed upon the possibility of the elimination of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) transmission using various interventions including mass drug administration. The primary diagnostic tool recommended by the WHO is the detection of STH eggs in stool using the Kato-Katz (KK) method. However, detecting infected individuals using this method becomes increasingly difficult as the intensity of infection decreases. Newer techniques, such as qPCR, have been shown to have greater sensitivity than KK, especially at low prevalence. However, the impact of using qPCR on elimination thresholds is yet to be investigated. In this paper, we aim to quantify how the sensitivity of these two diagnostic tools affects the optimal prevalence threshold at which to declare the interruption of transmission with a defined level of confidence. A stochastic, individual-based STH transmission model was used in this study to simulate the transmission dynamics of Ascaris and hookworm. Data from a Kenyan deworming study were used to parameterize the diagnostic model which was based on egg detection probabilities. The positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were calculated to assess the quality of any given threshold, with the optimal threshold value taken to be that at which both were maximised. The threshold prevalence of infection values for declaring elimination of Ascaris transmission were 6\% and 12\% for KK and qPCR respectively. For hookworm, these threshold values are lower at 0.5\% and 2\% respectively. Diagnostic tests with greater sensitivity are becoming increasingly important as we approach the elimination of STH transmission in some regions of the world. For declaring the elimination of transmission, using qPCR to diagnose STH infection results in the definition of a higher prevalence, than when KK is used., Soil-transmitted helminths are categorised as a neglected tropical disease and comprise four dominant species (two hookworms, Trichuris trichuria \& Ascaris lumbricoides) that affect the poorest people in the world. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has made great strides in reducing the morbidity induced by STH infections in pre-school aged and school-aged children through mass drug administration. Many countries are now considering moving from morbidity reduction in school-aged children to community-wide treatment with the aim of transmission elimination. These helminths reproduce sexually within a human host and therefore both male and female worms must be present to produce fertilized eggs. The density of female and male worms below which mating success is too low to sustain parasite populations is defined as the `breakpoint' in transmission. Both the prevalence and intensity of infection are very low as this breakpoint is approached when worm numbers are highly aggregated in their distribution within the human host population. Consequently, it becomes increasingly challenging to identify infected individuals using standard microscopic diagnostic tools (such as Kato-Katz). New and more sensitive molecular diagnostics tools, such as qPCR, are a necessity in settings where communities are moving towards the interruption of transmission. This paper demonstrates that the threshold to declare interruption of transmission is 50\% lower when microscopic techniques are applied compared with molecular techniques.},

Our analyses found a high correlation with S. haematobium intensity categories and morbidity indicators, especially microhematuria, but weaker correlation between S. mansoni intensity categories and morbidity indicators.
